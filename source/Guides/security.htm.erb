                <h4>Securing your wallet</h4>
                <p>
                    If your wallet.dat file is stolen, and it's unencrypted & you have no backup of the file, it's the equivelant of cash being stolen; there's no way of getting it back unless you catch the theif. Thusly, you must take proper precautions to prevent the loss/theft of your gridcoin.
                </p>
                <h5>Wallet security recommendations:</h5>
                <b>NOTE: PAPER WALLET INCOMPATIBLE WITH RESEARCH CLIENT/COINS!</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a <a href="http://walletgenerator.net/">paper wallet</a> and store it in a waterproof, safe environment.</li>
                    <li>Backup the wallet.dat file on encrypted USB sticks and store them in a safe.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, store an encrypted zip/rar/volume on any form of storage medium and keep it safe.</li>
                    <li>Regularly check that your backups work - if you encrypt your wallet then forget the pass, you're in trouble..</li>
                    <li>Read <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet">this wallet security guide</a> (for bitcoin, but relevant to gridcoin to some degree).</li>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h4>Securing your browser</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the most common attack vectors is through your web browser, so take precautionary measures to minimize risk of loss of funds/exposure to malware.
                </p>
                <h5>Non-extensive browser security recommendation:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stop using internet explorer, switch to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>, or one of the many variants of the two.</li>
                    <li>Do not use the same password for multiple sites.</li>
                    <li>Use long passwords! <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">the longer, the more difficult to crack.</a></li>
                    <li>Use 2 factor authentication like a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey/">Yubikey</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/">GoogleAuth</a> on any website that offers it; it's a second layer of defence against phishing.</li>
                    <li>If you've been sent a shortened link, either use a link preview service or flat up don't click it!</li>
                    <li>Disable any extensions that have been installed by 3rd party software - java/toolbars/etc, minus antivirus.</li>
                    <li>Update all plugins (flash/java/etc)</li>
                    <li>Use duckduckgo instead of google: <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
                </ul>
